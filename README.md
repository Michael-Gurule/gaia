#  Natural Disaster Risk Intelligence Platform

**Real-Time Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment for Real Estate Portfolios**

A production-grade data pipeline that ingests real-time data from government APIs (USGS, NASA, NOAA) to assess natural disaster risk across earthquakes, wildfires, and severe weather.

##  Business Problem

Real estate investors and insurance companies need comprehensive risk assessment across multiple natural hazards to make informed decisions and comply with SEC climate disclosure rules.

###  Solution

Production-grade data pipeline integrating real-time data from USGS (earthquakes), NASA FIRMS (wildfires), and NOAA (weather alerts) to calculate composite risk scores. 

###  Business Value

- **Multi-source government API integration** with error handling
- **Geographic risk scoring algorithm** with configurable weights
- **RESTful API with FastAPI** (6 endpoints)
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** with real-time visualizations
- **Production-grade error handling and retry logic**

###  Key Metrics

- **API Response Time:** <2 seconds for single location analysis
- **Data Sources:** 3 government APIs integrated
- **Risk Factors:** 5 hazard types assessed
- **Dashboard Load Time:** <3 seconds
- **Data Freshness:** Real-time (as current as government sources)

###  Features

- **Data Engineering:** Multi-source data integration, schema validation, error handling
- **API Development:** RESTful design, FastAPI, Pydantic models
- **Data Science:** Risk scoring algorithms, geographic analysis, statistical modeling
- **Visualization:** Plotly charts, interactive dashboards, Streamlit
- **Production Patterns:** Retry logic, connection pooling, monitoring


##  Algorithm Architecture

### Composite Risk Calculation:

- Weighted multi-hazard scoring system combining 5 disaster types
- Default weights: Wildfire (30%), Earthquake (25%), Weather (20%), Flood (15%), Heat (10%)
- Configurable weight parameters for custom risk profiles
- Scores normalized to 0-100 scale with risk level classification (Low/Moderate/High/Extreme)

### Individual Hazard Scoring:

- **Earthquake Risk:** Historical frequency × magnitude severity × proximity decay

  - **Frequency score:** Event count normalized to 50+ events = max risk
  - **Magnitude score:** Max magnitude normalized to 7.0+ = max risk
  - **Weighted combination:** 60% frequency + 40% magnitude

- **Wildfire Risk:** Active fire detections × intensity × distance decay

  - **Frequency score:** Fire count normalized to 20+ fires = max risk
  - **Intensity score:** Fire Radiative Power normalized to 500 MW = max risk
  - **Proximity score:** Distance-based decay function
  - **Weighted combination:** 40% frequency + 30% intensity + 30% proximity

- **Weather Risk:** NOAA alert severity mapping

  - **Extreme alerts** = 100, **Severe** = 75, **Moderate** = 50, **Minor** = 25

### Geographic Processing:

- Haversine distance calculation for accurate geographic proximity
- Configurable search radius (default: 500km for earthquakes, 100km for wildfires)
- Time-based filtering (365 days for seismic, 30 days for fires)

### Data Quality & Validation:

- Schema validation for inconsistent government API responses
- Null handling and data completeness checks
- Outlier detection and normalization

### Performance Optimization:

- Vectorized NumPy operations for distance calculations
- Pandas-based data processing for efficiency
- Cached connector instances for reduced API calls

###  Data Sources

- **USGS**: Earthquake data (earthquake.usgs.gov)
- **NASA FIRMS**: Wildfire data (firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov)
- **NOAA**: Weather alerts (api.weather.gov)
